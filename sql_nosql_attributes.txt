1. SQL, 2. NoSQL, examples of NoSQL: 

Type
1. Relational RDBMS 
2. 'Not only SQL', realational OR non-relational (mostly NR)

Language
1. SQL
2. Varies, link through APIs (application programming interfaces)

Schema Design
1. Table-like
2. Dynamic & unstructured

Scalability
1. Vertical (upgrade in hardware to increase capacity)
2. Vertical & horizontal (can add more machines in parallel and split data across these machines - commodity hardware)
   Sharding - e.g. MMO games
Non-relational scales up better than relational

Structure
1. Related tables
2. Key-values, Documents, Column families, Graphs, etc. (depends on which type we choose!)


TYPE OF NON-RELATIONAL DBs
Key-value store DBs (like python dictionaries)
Document store DBs
Column family (like key-value + timestamp)
Graph DBs
