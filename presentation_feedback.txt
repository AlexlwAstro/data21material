my presentation feedback from David

we fell into trap of not knowing audience - CRUCIAL!
more useful - "we had 1 day sprints with sprint retrospectives"
more details on implementation - WHAT WE ACTUALLY DID!
logging DEBUG level outputs helps for products
include 'requirements.txt' file in main directory with Python module installation requirements
classes directory with file for each class - small-ish classes please!
COMMENTS PLEASE!!!
well-named files!
alawys having __init.py file for package running
